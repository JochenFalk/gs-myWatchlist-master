The application “myWatchlist” provides users to create one or more lists of movies the user likes to keep track of. Movies can be added to a list by selecting the “Search” button at the top of every page within the application. Additionally the application provides the user with recommendations based on either popularity, all-time best rated movies, or similarity throughout different sections of the application.
